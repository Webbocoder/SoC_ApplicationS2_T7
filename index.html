          <p id="intro-to-selection">Below are a selection of his seminal works, as picked by him <a id="reich-on-reich-vid-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FqYoHFHZo" target="_blank">here.</a> It is by no means a complete list of his works. Note how his early works are quite hardcore in their minimalism and his mid-later works become more accessible.</p>

        <div id="it's-gonna-rain-div">

          <h3 id="it's-gonna-rain-h3">It's Gonna Rain (1965)</h3>

          <p id="it's-gonna-rain-description">"A minimalist music composition for magnetic tape." "For the recording, Reich used two normal Wollensak tape recorders with the same recording, originally attempting to align the phrase with itself at the halfway point (180 degrees). However, due to the imprecise technology in 1965, the two recordings fell out of sync, with one tape gradually falling ahead or behind the other due to minute differences in the machines, the length of the spliced tape loops, and playback speed. Reich decided to exploit what is known as phase shifting, where all possible repeated harmonies are explored before the two loops eventually get back in sync." <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/It%27s_Gonna_Rain">Source</a></p>

        <div id="piano-phase-div">

          <h3 id="piano-phase-h3">Piano Phase (1967)</h3>

          <p id="piano-phase-description">A minimalist piece written for two pianos for which Reich asks the players to recreate the phase shifting effect of previous tape pieces. One player repeats a short phrase, whilst another plays the same phrase and slowly increases its speed until it is one semiquaver ahead, and then another semiquaver, etc, until they are back in sync. This happens with 3 related phrases. Source: my own listening.</p>

        <div id="drumming-div">

          <h3 id="drumming-h3">Drumming (1971)</h3>

          <p id="drumming-description">A large-scale minimalist piece in that it uses minimalist techniques but it is approximately an hour to an hour and a half in length and requires up to 13 players. "Reich began composition of the work after a short visit to Ghana and observing music and musical ensembles there." Other than African rhythms and phase shifting, Reich used a number of techniques in this work which were important for later pieces, including note addition and subtraction, mixing different timbres, and the imitation of melodies which result from two or more phased melodies. Steve Reich described this work as his exit from the hardcore minimalism movement, even if he didn't know it at the time. "Classical music critic K. Robert Schwarz describes the work as "minimalism's first masterpiece"." <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drumming_(Reich)">Source_1</a> <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=l4FqYoHFHZo&feature=shares">Source_2</a></p>

          <h3 id="music-for-18-musicians-h3">Music For 18 Musicians (1976)</h3>

          <p id="music-for-18-musicians-description">This piece is centred around 11 consonant chords which are "pulsed" out twice each in the work's start and end movements entitled "Pulses". Between them, a "piece" is composed based on each chord. So much more can be said about this work, but I won't lest this become an essay. Music critics wrote of it: "[Its] impact on the new music scene was immediate and overwhelming. Anyone who saw potential in minimalism and had hoped for a major breakthrough piece found it here. ... Instead of the sterile, electronic sound usually associated with minimalism, the music's warm resonance was a welcome change." "[It's] very mathematical, yet also very, well, organic." "The high point of ensemble music of the 1970s by composers identified as Minimalist". <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_for_18_Musicians">Source</a></p>

        <div id="different-trains-div">

          <h3 id="different-trains-h3">Different Trains (1988)</h3>

          <p id="different-trains-description">A piece for string quartet and tape in three movements: I. America - Before the War; II. Europe - During the War; and III. After the War. "Reich's earlier work had frequently used tape... however, Different Trains was a novel experiment, using recorded speech as a source for melodies." "During World War II, Reich made train journeys between New York and Los Angeles to visit his parents, who had separated. Years later, he pondered the fact that, as a Jew, had he been in Europe instead of the United States at that time, he might have been traveling in Holocaust trains." <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Different_Trains">Source</a></p>

        <div id="the-cave-div">

          <h3 id="the-cave-h3">The Cave (1993)</h3>

          <p id="the-cave-description">I admit I hadn't actually heard of this one before this project, but it appears to be an opera which uses the same technique of using recorded speech as a source for melodies which Different Trains used. "The Cave is a multimedia opera in three acts by Steve Reich to an English libretto by his wife Beryl Korot. It was first performed in 1993 in Vienna by the Steve Reich Ensemble, conducted by Paul Hillier. The title "The Cave" refers to The Cave of the Patriarchs in Hebron, where Abraham and Sarah (and several other major religious figures) are buried." <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cave_(opera)">Source</a></p>

        <p id="introducing-infuence">The influence of Reich and his music can be heard in numerous artists, both in the contemporary classical and popular spheres. Such an influence can be heard in examples of each of the following composers' music which use techniques similar that of Steve Reich, but in a way that is still unique to each of them.</p>

          <p id="louis-andriessen-description">Whilst Reich reacted against the dissonance of preceding avant guard music, the Dutch composer Louis Andriessen embraced it and combined it with the techniques of Reich and his contemporaries to create a brutish new music often composed to comment on things, rather than to just be for the sake of music itself. <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/music/2021/jul/02/louis-andriessen-six-of-the-best">Source</a></p>
